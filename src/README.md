# CSC540 Project

	The system has a main menu that gives the user the following options: “Drivers”, “ParkingLot”, “Zones”, “Spaces”, “Vehicles”, “Citations”, “Reports”,
“Initialize”,and “Exit”. When prompted, the user enters a number 1-10 corresponding with what kind of action they would like to take. For each menu option there is a submenu displayed that has specific operations listed. Our system has a main class (Main.java) that facilitates switching between the main menu options and separate classes for each related group of operations. This was done to break the application into more manageable and maintainable pieces of code. Our program also contains a DBTablePrinter class which is used for formatting the output. 
	The primary menu offers a selection of options for navigating to different functionalities such as Drivers, Zone, Spaces, ParkingLot, Vehicles, Permits, 
Citations,and Reports. The Driver's menu includes sub-menus for operations like adding, updating, and deleting driver information, taking input from the user. It also provides options for exiting and returning to the main menu. Similarly, the ParkingLot menu comprises sub-menus allowing users to add, update, and delete Parking Lot information, with options for exiting and returning to the main menu. The Zones menu presents choices for assigning a zone, updating, and deleting zone
information, as well as exiting and returning to the main menu. In the Spaces menu, users can add, update, and delete Space information, assign types to spaces, and find options for exiting and returning to the main menu. The Vehicles menu provides options for adding, updating, and deleting vehicle information, with choices for exiting and returning to the main menu. The Permits menu includes operations like assigning permits to drivers, updating permit information, deleting permit information, adding vehicles to permits, deleting vehicles from permits, and returning to the main menu. The Citations menu offers options for adding, updating, and deleting citation information, appealing citations, updating payment status and appeal status for the citation, and includes choices to exit or return to the main menu. Lastly, the Reports are generated using the Reports menu provides various options for generating reports, such as citations reports, the cumulative number of citations within a specified time frame, whether on a monthly, annual, or custom basis within a given period., zone lists for each lot, number of cars currently in violation, number of employees with permits for a zone, permit information by ID or phone number, available space numbers by space type in a lot, and an option to return to the main menu. Handicap people can receive a discount of 50% on the citation fee, also students and visitors are allowed a single permit, while the employee is allowed two permits. Additionally, both students and employees are allowed a additional permit for special events, or park, and ride.
